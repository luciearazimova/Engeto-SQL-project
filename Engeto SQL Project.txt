Engeto project 'Czechia payroll and Czechia price'

Assignment number 1

- Creating a table with data for comparing food availability based on average incomes over a certain period of time.

Solution
I created a table with documents based on the czechia_payroll and czechia_price datasets. The table displays information on average salaries in selected economic sectors in the years 2000 – 2021 and then average prices of selected food categories in the Czech Republic in the years 2006 – 2018.

- Creation of a table with GDP, GINI coefficient and population of other European countries in the same period as the primary overview for the Czech Republic.

Solution
The sources listed in the countries and economies datasets are not compatible and it is not possible to create a table from them according to the specification.

Assignment number 2

Based on the available data, answer the following research questions:

1. Are wages rising in all industries over the years, or falling in some?

Yes, wages have declined across industries over the years, the most in 2013, when average salaries fell in 11 industries. The years compared are 2000 to 2021.


2. How many liters of milk and kilograms of bread can be bought in the first and last comparable periods in the available price and wage data?

According to the available data, I compared the years 2006 and 2018. The amount of liters of milk and kilograms of bread that can be bought differs significantly for employees in different economic sectors. In 2006, the employees from the financial and insurance industries could buy the most kilograms of bread and liters of milk, namely 2,461.64 kg and 2,749 l. In 2018, it was employees from information and communication activities with 2,314.56 kg of bread and 2,830, 64 liters of milk.

Least kilograms of bread and liters of milk could be bought by employees in accommodation and catering. It was 706.43 kg in 2006 and 774.39 kg of bread in 2018 and 788.89 L of milk in 2006 and 947.06 L of milk in 2018. The data shows that the staff has improved over the years.

 

3. Which food category is increasing in price the slowest (has the lowest percentage year-on-year increase)?

Crystal sugar rose in price the slowest, which, on the other hand, fell in price by 27.51% between 2006 and 2018.

 

4. Has there been a year in which the year-on-year increase in food prices was significantly higher than wage growth (greater than 10%)?

The data makes it possible to compare the increase between 2007 and 2018, and the results show that the difference in the growth of average prices and wages has never been greater than 10%.


5. Does the level of GDP affect changes in wages and food prices? Or, if the GDP increases more significantly in one year, will this be reflected in food prices or wages in the same or the following year by a more significant increase?

This question cannot be answered. It is not determined what a significant increase in prices means. It would be necessary to determine the percentage difference.
